# TodoMVC React Redux Experimentation

The original source code came from Jack Hsu: http://jaysoo.ca/

in his repo:

https://github.com/jaysoo/todomvc-redux-react-typescript

... which is yet another implementation of TodoMVC.

## This Repo

I am experimenting with build/packaging tools. I started with his source
code for the client implementation, and from scratch on the tooling,
looking for something minimal and fast.
